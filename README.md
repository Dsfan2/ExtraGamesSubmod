### Game Decriptions:

## The Millionaire Game:
![MAS: The Millionaire Game](https://github.com/Dsfan2/ExtraGamesSubmod/blob/main/pics/The%20Millionaire%20Game%20Screenshot%20One.png)
A recreation of the classic game show, "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"! (Using the classic format, NOT the shuffle format!)
Get all 15 questions right and you win the Million*! But get one wrong, and you lose!
The questions will get harder as the game progresses, that's why you have 3 lifelines!
You can only use a lifeline once per game though, so use them wisely...
Can you smart it out and win the Million*?

*Disclaimer: You can't actually win any amount of actual money here...
